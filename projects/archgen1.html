					<h1 class="section">- Islamic architecture</h1>
					<p class="sep"></p>
					<p class="text">
					The idea is to hierarchically construct buildings by instantiating pre-modelled, 3D pieces.<br>
					A Markov-chain-like grammar can be used to procedurally design a tree of objects, where the leaves are simple solid shapes.<br>
					Keeping the models as bare-bone as possible will allow the algorithm to scale in complexity, while simultaneously drastically reducing the costs of the modelling process.<br>
					<br>
					I have chosen to look at islamic architecture for inspiration. I guess it looks more organic and less "planned" than other kinds of monumental art, so that even a randomised group of buildings will look alright.
					<br>
					<br>
					Not a game, not a complicated algorithm, just a toy.

						"Bottom-up" (16/02/2018)
					</p>
					<p class="text">
					As a first step i'm experimenting with Blender and laying down the foundations for the entire system. Basic shapes and blocks, basic primitives and modules.<br>
					I have never done any 3D modelling and i dont really have much experience with Unity, either. I hope i'll learn something along the way.<br>
					Rather than starting from the layout of the buildings, i'm starting with a basic randomisation system for the smallest elements: columns and arches. These pieces will later be part of more complex structures.<br>
					First of all, i modelled a few bases, shafts and capitals in Blender (ouch). Then i chucked them into a basic system that picks one of each at random and makes a column out of them. <br>
					Simple enough. <br></p>

					<p class="sep-white-16"></p>
					<p class="text">
					Then, onto something slightly (barely) more interesting. Two columns plus a ...top bit thingy? make an arch. Then you take many arches and stick them all in a line.<br> 
					It makes sense.<br></p>
					<p class="sep-white-16"></p>

					<p class="text">
					Exporting stuff from Blender into Unity is a nightmare (if you're as new as i am to all this), the orientation ends up completely wrong 200% of the times, and the scale goes weird aswell. I spent most of the day rotating things at random hoping they would come out right after the import.
					<br> 
					Needless to say they didn't. <br>
